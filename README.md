      Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are
      utilized in the process of communication between different types of
      devices over the internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web
      browsers can be defined as programs that display text, data, pictures,
      animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World
      Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web
      browsers.

    <h1>World Wide Web (WWW):</h1>
    <a href="#wt" style="font-size: x-large;">Return to Web Technology</a>
    <p class="p-text">The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> abbreviated as WWW and commonly known as the web. The WWW was initiated by
        CERN (European library for Nuclear Research) in 1989.</p>
    <h3>History: </h3>
    <p class="p-text">It is a project created, by Timothy Berner’s Lee in 1989, for researchers to work together effectively at CERN.
        is an organization, named World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which was developed for further development in the
        web. This organization is directed by Tim Berner’s Lee, aka the father of the web.</p>
    <h3>System Architecture: </h3>
    <p class="p-text">From the user’s point of view, the web consists of a vast, worldwide connection of documents or web pages. Each
        page may contain links to other pages anywhere in the world. The pages can be retrieved and viewed by using
        browsers of which internet explorer, Netscape Navigator, Google, Chrome, etc are the popular ones. The browser
        fetches the page requested interprets the text and formatting commands on it, and displays the page, properly
        formatted, on the screen.
        <br>The basic model of how the web works are shown in the figure below. Here the browser is displaying a web
        page on the client machine. When the user clicks on a line of text that is linked to a page on the abd.com
        server, the browser follows the hyperlink by sending a message to the abd.com server asking it for the page.

    <h3>Working of WWW: </h3>
    <p class="p-text">
        The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
        and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

        A Web browser is used to access webpages. Web browsers can be defined as programs which display text, data,
        pictures, animation and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using
        software interface provided by Web browsers. Initially Web browsers were used only for surfing the Web but now
        they have become more universal. Web browsers can be used for several tasks including conducting searches,
        mailing, transferring files, and much more. Some of the commonly used browsers are Internet Explorer, Opera
        Mini, Google Chrome.
        <h3>Features of WWW: </h3>

    <p class="p-text">When we need any kind of information most of the time we get help from the Internet, and we get information. The
        Internet provides us useful information easily; we use mobile phones, computers, and tablets. We searched for a
        lot of things in our daily life, so we get information about all over the world, but we can not get information
        by just only getting connected to the Internet. We need a platform where we can search for our questions. The
        platform that provides such kinds of services is called a web browser, without a web browser internet will not
        be able to provide information.</p>

    <h3>What is the Web Browser?</h3>
    <p class="p-text">The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide Web). It provides an interface between the
        server and the client and requests to the server for web documents and services. It works as a compiler to
        render HTML which is used to design a webpage. Whenever we search anything on the internet, the browser loads a
        web page written in HTML, including text, links, images, and other items such as style sheets and JavaScript
        functions. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari are examples of web browsers. </p>

    <h3>History of the web browser</h3>
    <p class="p-text">The first web browser WorldWideWeb was invented in the year of 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. Later, it becomes Nexus.
        In the year of 1993, a new browser Mosaic was invented by Mark Andressen and their team. It was the first
        browser to display text and images at a time on the device screen. He also invents another browser Netscape in
        1994. Next year Microsoft launched a web browser Internet Explorer which was already installed in Windows
        operating system. After this many browsers were invented with various features like Mozilla Firefox, Google
        Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc. </p>

    <h3>How does a web browser work?</h3>
    <p class="p-text">A web browser helps us find information anywhere on the internet. It is installed on the client computer and
        requests information from the webserver such a type of working model is called a client-server model. </p>

    <img src="./Assets/webbrowser.png" alt="">
    <p class="p-text">The browser receives information through HTTP protocol. In which transmission of data is defined. When the
        browser received data from the server, it is rendered by HTML to user-readable form and, information displayed
        on the device screen. </p>

    <h3>Website Cookies</h3>
    <p class="p-text">When we visited any website over the internet our web browser stores information about us in small files called
        cookies. Cookies are designed to remember stateful information about our browsing history. Some more cookies are
        used to remember about us like our interests, our browsing patterns, etc. Websites show us ads based on our
        interests using cookies. </p>

    <h3>Some popular Web Browsers</h3>
    <p class="p-text">There are some popular and most used web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari,
        etc. </p>

    <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
    <p class="p-text">Google Chrome is the world’s most used web browser. In 77% of devices, Google Chrome is used. This browser
        developed by Google in 2008 for Microsoft Windows. Later it used in macOS, Linux, Android, iOS operating
        systems. It is a very reliable browser and available in 47 languages. The installation process of Google Chrome
        is very easy and free for everyone. </p>

    <h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
    <p class="p-text">Mozilla Firefox also knows as the Firefox browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation
        in 2002. It is available on Linux, Microsoft Windows, Android, and iOS operating systems. In the Linux system,
        the Mozilla Firefox is the default installed browser. </p>

        <a href="#wt" style="font-size: x-large;">Return to Web Technology</a>
        <p class="p-text"><strong>Web Server</strong>is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
            Basically, web servers are computers used to store HTTP files which makes a website and when a client requests a certain website, it delivers the requested website to the client. For example, you want to open Facebook on your laptop and enter the URL in the search bar of google. Now, the laptop will send an HTTP request to view the facebook webpage to another computer known as the webserver. This computer (webserver) contains all the files (usually in HTTP format) which make up the website like text, images, gif files, etc. After processing the request, the webserver will send the requested website-related files to your computer and then you can reach the website.
            Different websites can be stored on the same or different web servers but that doesn’t affect the actual website that you are seeing in your computer. The web server can be any software or hardware but is usually a software running on a computer. One web server can handle multiple users at any given time which is a necessity otherwise there had to be a web server for each user and considering the current world population, is nearly close to impossible. A web server is never disconnected from the internet because if it was, then it won’t be able to receive any requests, and therefore cannot process them.</p>
            <p><img src="./Assets/webserver.png" alt=""></p>

            <p class="p-text">There are many web servers available in the market both free and paid. Some of them are described below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p class="p-text"><strong>Apache HTTP server: </strong>It is the most popular web server and about 60 percent of the world’s web server machines run this web server. The Apache HTTP web server was developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an open-source software which means that we can access and make changes to its code and mold it according to our preference. The Apache Web Server can be installed and operated easily on almost all operating systems like Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.</p></li>
                <p><img src="./Assets/Apachewebserver.png" alt=""></p>

                <li><p class="p-text"><strong>Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS):</strong>IIS (Internet Information Services) is a high performing web server developed by Microsoft. It is strongly united with the operating system and is therefore relatively easier to administer. It is developed by Microsoft, it has a good customer support system which is easier to access if we encounter any issue with the server. It has all the features of the Apache HTTP Server except that it is not an open-source software and therefore its code is inaccessible which means that we cannot make changes in the code to suit our needs. It can be easily installed in any Windows device.</p></li>
